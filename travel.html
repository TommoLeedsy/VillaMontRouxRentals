           <h2>Direction To The Villa From Nice Airport</h2>
           <p>Take the A8  which is the main autoroute towards the direction of Cannes (Heading west). You will arrive at 2 paeges along the way. The first one you pay 2.50 euros, so be sure to have some euros on you, otherwise the trusty old plastic will work. The second paege you take a ticket and pay when you get off the A8.  Continue on the A8 until you get to the exit that says Le Muy, Draginaun, St Maxine, St Tropez. You will arrive at the paege and pay 4.00 euros. You will turn right just after the paege, you will see a sign that says St Tropez. Follow this windy road and you will eventually arrive in St Maxine, there will be several roundabouts, just keep following the signs towards St Tropez. Eventually they will say Grimaud and then start following these. You will turn right off this coast road just after the big Campsite on the beach and the Bowling, the road is marked Grimaud (D140). When you get to the roundabout continue toward the direction of Grimaud. You will see a bus stop on the right hand side just after a sign that says Domaine de la Bergerie.  Just after the bus stop, take a hard right with the little green signs, one of them says  Chemin de St Joseph.  Continue down this lane when the road splits (you will see a pillar with a little statue in it), take the left. Continue down the hill and when you see a red sign saying Domaine de Val Grimaud, turn left. Go through the green gates, go up the little hill, turn left at the top and the house is the first house on the right. Itâ€™s number 24, a black gate with two lions on either side.</p>
